Testing math.

Let $$\mathcal{S}$$ be an inverse semigroup. A \textit{semicharacter} is a non-zero semigroup homomorphism $$E(\mathcal{S}) \to \{0, 1\}$$, while a \textit{character} is a monoid homomorphism $$E(\mathcal{S}) \to \{0, 1\}$$ (that is, a character is simply a semicharacter that maps 0 to 0, if $$\mathcal{S}$$ has one). Recall that a \textit{filter on $$E(\mathcal{S})$$} is a subset $$F \subseteq E(\mathcal{S})$$ that is non-empty, upward-closed, and downward-directed. One can show that if $$\varphi$$ is a semicharacter on $$E(\mathcal{S})$$, then $$F \colon= \varphi^{-1}(1)$$ is a filter on $$E(\mathcal{S})$$. Furthermore, $$F$$ is a proper filter exactly when $$\varphi$$ is a character. A filter $$F$$ is \textit{principal} if it is of the form $$\{e : e \leq f\}$$ for some $$f \in E$$ - in this case, we write $$F = f^{\uparrow}$$. Furthermore, we say $$F$$ is an \textit{ultrafilter} if it is maximal among all proper filters by inclusion.
